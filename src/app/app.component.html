    D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you 
    bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you 
    the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, 
    combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

    One of the best things that I like about D3 is the ridiculous amount of awesome 
    demos available online and last night I have stumbled on an excel sheet with 1,134 
    examples of data visualizations with D3. If you are just starting out with D3 you 
    will appreciate the well organized API docs and really great tutorials and cheat sheets 
    but there is nothing like seeing a demo with code. There are many D3 examples online but
     I have not seen such a big list published anywhere so I am dropping it below, with 
     thumbnail images of each D3 demo on link mouseover.
